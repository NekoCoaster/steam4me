				<p>This has to be the most common error message I receive enquiries about.</p>

                <p>It usually doesn't interfere with running MSTS, and you can click "Yes" to continue, but every time you start or stop an activity or open the Activity Editor you're confronted with this message.  The activities that use this item of rolling stock usually can't be run either.  I get 2-3 emails a week asking me where this error came from and how to get rid of it.</p>

                <p>The glib one-line answer is "<i>this error message means that there is a consist asking for a non-existent piece of rollingstock.</i>"</p>

                <p>Well, that's really helpful isn't it?  I'm going to show you how to track down and eliminate these errors using Mike Simpson's incredible Swiss-Army knife fix-everything program, <b><a href="Route_Riter/index.html">Route Riter</a> (versions 7.0.50 or higher).</b>.</p>

                <p>Here's a quick answer if the error message contains a reference to lines 90-190 (or thereabouts), it's generally a locomotive with lighting set up for the MSTS-Bin patch being used on a default installation of MSTS.</p>

			<h2 class="title">Error Message - Train World Initialization Failed</h2>
			<div class="entry">
				<p><b>Reason #1:</b> If the route uses Kosmos environments, you may need to check the "Textured Sky" option in <b>MSTS | Options | Advanced Display</b>.</p>

                <p><b>Reason #2</b>:  "Train World Initialization Failed" means something is missing/corrupted in the \envfiles folder, so you could try copying the \envfiles folder from \train simulator\template to see if that fixes it.  In a similar vein, the installme.bat file may not have run correctly or to completion when installing a new route.  Try running it again, watching for multiple "1 File(s) Copied" messages.
                   <br>(Jim "Sniper" Ward)</p>

                   <p><b>Reason #3:</b> If you have an AI train which has been parked on a siding behind a red light, as described in <a href="#">Method #2 of making an AI train stop at a terminal</a> station, and you save the activity after the train has stopped, when you try to reload the activity, you will get "Train World Initialization Failed", EVERY time.</p>

                   <p>Unfortunately, the solution is to remove the AI train from the activity. MSTS seems to be incapable of restarting with a "stopped" AI train.

				<p>You may be missing one or more of the following folders in your route: TRAFFIC, PATHS, SERVICES, ACTIVITIES. If any of these folders are missing create them with the <b>File | New | Folder</b> command in Windows Explorer.</p>

    <p><b>Special note to route-builders creating Clickteam installers for distribution of their route</b>: When setting up your install files, note that InstallCreator or the older InstallMaker do not copy empty folders.

    <p>The fix is to create a non-empty file called say blank.fil&nbsp; - note file must have something in it eg "This file required for installer to work correctly - you may now delete it".&nbsp; The folder will then be copied into the installer.</p>

    <p>Note: The option in InstallCreator in Files Tab, Misc Tab for "Do not install file, but create directory" was broken in the free versions with build numbers less than 17 (current build is 31, so upgrading your Clickteam InstallCreator will solve this problem).

				<p>The problem is one of the registry entries. The registry must point to a complete and valid MSTS installation - doesn't matter if it's your main MSTS installation or a mini-MSTS.</p>

                <p><b>Background:</b> my MSTS is a combination of the standard MSTS installation along with several mini-MSTS installations. Setting up appropriate shortcuts for each mini-MSTS, I'm able to run trains or edit any route (main or mini) without touching the registry values. I DO need to change the registry to be able to install an APK (see <a href="Route_Riter/unpack_apk.html">hhttp://msts.steam4me.net/Route_Riter/unpack_apk.html</a>). All of this has worked without any issues till now.</p>

                <p>I'd been working on beta-testing some new Route_Riter (RR) features and I wanted to be able to test some features regarding rollingstock adjustments without jeopardising my standard or mini-route setups. I set up a TEST folder with a global SOUND folder, a ROUTE folder with the tiny Timesaver route (RR crashes on startup if there's no Route in an MSTS installation), a TRAINS (includiing TRAINSET and CONSISTS) folder with the rollingstock appropriately placed. In this particular test module, RR uses the registry settings to point to the appropriate set of ENG/WAG files to be tested.</p>

                <p>RR only looks for <b>train.exe</b> when you do a registry change, so I copied only train.exe into the top TEST folder and then used RR's registry change feature to point to the TEST folder. The beta-test went ok. But now I got the "Failed...." error message: I got it in all my MSTS installations - main and minis: both in running the sims and trying to use the editors/tools.</p>

                <p>As soon as I used RR to point to a complete MSTS installation (main or mini), the problem went away.

				<p>This appears to be a major MSTS-killer! The <b>"Mother Of All MSTS Errors!"</b>.  <b>There is no known cure, save re-installation</b>.  As of September 2008, I've suggested you try this: delete your Global folder, replace it with your backup Global folder (you did make a backup of your Global folder when you installed MSTS, didn't you?), then re-install Xtracks, Newroads and/or UKFinescale (if you use these add-ons). I've had only ONE person report success with this method; no-one else to my knowledge has ever found the cause or cure for this error.  Restoring registry keys doesn't appear to work.  Failing that, move all your routes and trains away from MSTS, UNINSTALL MSTS, delete any remaining MSTS folders and re-install MSTS. (You may find <a href="tutorials/installing_msts_xp.html&quot;">Re-installing MSTS</a> helpful).</p>

<p>Many MSTS users have spent many many hours trying to locate this source of this error without success.  Typically, Conbuilder's and Route_Riter's test routines find no errors.  One user found that it was caused by a corrupt WAG file, but all too often this error occurs right across all routes and all models in MSTS - doesn't seem to matter whether you have default-MSTS or MSTS-Bin, whether you use Trainstore or not.</p>

<p>If you can't locate the source of the error within a couple of hours (and I'd love to hear from you if you do - see "Contact me" on Home Page)), give up, re-install MSTS and then carefully add back each add-on route and item of rolling stock, testing each as you install them.</p>

This is often caused by the Activity Editor locking up when trying to save or re-save an activity.  Check the .act file - it will most likely be empty.  Delete and rebuild. Paths, services and consists used by that activity will be intact.</li>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>This error message ""Failed to locate a required file in your installation. You may need to re-install train simulator" is usually caused by a shortcut pointing to an invalid installation of MSTS or an incorrect location.  Most commonly seen after creation of mini-routes and subsequent faulty Registry entries.</p>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>This error message may suddenly appear when trying to start Conbuilder or Route_Riter, even after these programs having been running error-free for months or years.</p>

  			    <p><img src="images/picformat_missing.jpg" height="133" alt="picformat32.ocx is missing" border="0"></p>

  			    <p>Your first reaction may be to re-register the .ocx by typing this command into a DOS/Command Line prompt: <b>regsvr32.exe picformat32.ocx</b></p>

  			    <p>If this doesn't correct the problem, it may well be that your anti-virus program has taken a dislike to the picformat32.ocx file (which has been around since 2003).  Simply set your a/v program to "ignore" or "whitelist" picformat32.ocx and the problem will go away.</p>

This means that route was built using the default tsection.dat file, located in the Global folder, whereas you currently have the standardised tsection.dat file installed.
