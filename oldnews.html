			<div class="entry">
				<p>Wayne Campbell, who avid MSTS fans will know as the creator of the super-detailed <a href="http://www.lnps.info/&quot;">London and Port Stanley route</a> has commenced work on an MSTS-compatible <b>open source</b> train simulator called <a href="http://www.openrails.org/">Open Rails</a>.  Whilst still in alpha release, it's a credit to Wayne and his team that routes and rolling stock are already working in this new simulation.  Exciting news indeed as we witness the gradual wind-down in availability of MSTS disks.  Click on the link above to have a look or download the working alpha release.

			<div class="entry">

                        <p>The latest version of Zonealarm is flagging Clickteam installers as containing malicious code.  I picked this up when downloading a Clickteam installer from another site on the web.  I then tested my own installers and found that ZA was also flagging my installers as dangerous.</p>

<p>This happens from time to time from all major anti-virus vendors as their scanning systems detect some similarity in code and overstate the risk.  It appears that the screening process is picking up some code within these installers that is also used by malaware.</p>

<p>Even Zonealarm gives a subsequent "clean bill of health" to these files that it initially flags as dangerous.  Each installer is always tested before release and is clean.   Be assured - it is safe to download and install steam4me installers on your systems.</p>

<p>Subsequent updates of the anti-virus updates corrected their error.

Mike Simpson has released v7.0.85 of his awesome "Swiss Army knife" utility for MSTS - Route Riter.  This has involved a major rewrite using Carl-Heinz Rave's TsUtils Java functions to compress/uncompress .s/.t and .w files wherever this is necessary in the program. 

<p>Mike has had to do this as previous compress/uncompress utilities don't work under Vista, and this release consolidates one version of Route Riter for both XP and Vista.

<p>This major rewrite means that there is no longer any requirement for Microsoft .Net Framework to be installed for RR to run A recent version of Java is necessary.  Visit the definitive and complete <a href="Route_Riter/index.html"><b>Route Riter site</b></a> for the latest full and update installs as they become available.

<p>Versions less than 7.0.85 are no longer supported.  A full install of 7.0.85 or higher is recommended to ensure that you have all the most recent files (you do not need to uninstall an older version of Route Riter first).

<p>As if all that wasn't enough, there are now 12 tutorials on using the various components of Route Riter to help you in both route-building and rolling stock upgrades.

<p>I've had quite a few emails about the site's presence (or otherwise) over the past few weeks.

<p>The steam4me site is back and stable now after a couple of weeks of problems in early June.  I thought I'd give you some background as there's been a bit of speculation on some overseas forums.

<p>There are two major servers at Railpage, one serving the Railpage forums (fora?), the Locomotive Page, the Coals To Newcastle page and James Brook's excellent VR Railfan site; and the other server looking after the steam4me site: this makes it easier for the people at Railpage to best service the high bandwidth that MSTS users around the world seem to need.  I've said it before and I'll say it again - a heartfelt thanks to the people at Railpage who provide up to an extraordinary 1,000G of bandwidth per month for MSTS users alone - all at no charge to the world-wide MSTS community.

<p>About three weeks ago, the server on which steam4me resides failed and a new server was commissioned.  Unfortunately, during the restore-from-back-up process, the URL somehow got corrupted with the main URL pointing directly to the MSTS page, resulting in no MSTS as everything was a folder level out of whack.  Thanks to Michael Greenhill and the Railpage support crew, this was quickly sorted out.  While the other server still has some issues and is occasionally down, I'm pleased to say that the steam4me's server has been very reliable since its upgrade: in fact, I'm convinced it's quicker than ever before.

<p>Over the coming weeks, there will be more content coming to steam4me, both new material as well as the return of long-missed favourites.  Much South Australian Railway stock has been added or returned to the site in anticipation of the imminent release of Allan Lownsborough's amazing "Adelaide, Hills and South-East" route.  The SA 830 and 930 class are two such examples, the 930s returning just today.

<p>Stay tuned for further news. {1,935,546}

on a high-speed romp through Germany on the world-famous Deutsche Bahn

its predecessor left off. Microsoft Train Simulator 2 also adds dynamic
weather in a living-breathing world complete with people, vehicles and

I understand that many of you are frustrated at the repeated delays on
the release of R711 (almost matching the prototype in delays &lt;g!>) and
I understand (but don't enjoy) that the abusive foul-mouthed emails that
I'm currently receiving are mostly written by arrogant, self-centred, pre-pubescent
"gimme pigs" that unfortunately have no other life outside their PCs.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#999999">As the person who originally
suggested R711 to Joseph (including supplying plans, CDs of photos and
obtaining the fantastic co-operation of WCR staff), the delays are frustrating
to me as well.&nbsp; But before you get bent out of shape, let's all remember
that</font> <b><font color="#FF0000">MSTS is A HOBBY NOT A WAY OF LIFE</font></b>,<font color="#999999">
and unless your name is Bill Gates or Kuju, you make no money at all out
of MSTS, nor does the MSTS hobby assure your future financial security.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#999999">Joseph is currently writing
a thesis as part of his final year at university: this important facet
of his studies affects his future as it will substantially assist him along
his career path in his chosen field of employment.&nbsp; There is no way
that Joseph can be expected to neglect his studies for this hobby.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#999999">In addition, I am in full-time
employ (not a shift worker nor unemployed nor retired as some have suggested)
and have a growing family that I devote considerable time to:&nbsp; MSTS
would be a nice hobby to have, but then there's a web page that takes up
most of my online time &lt;G!>.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#999999">The problem with R711 stems
back to some design changes that were made to R711's tender along the way
over the past few months.&nbsp; This happened while we were awaiting the
production of a cab by Dream In Vision.&nbsp; While DIV's timetables have
also been shot to pieces by other contract work (don't forget R711 is going
to be freeware and thus is worked on on a "when-time-is-available" basis),
they did assist in fine-tuning .S and .ACE files for both loco and tender.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#999999">When the files were sent
to me for final packaging, they arrived the day before I went to Tasmania
on holidays and I only briefly looked at them - the </font><b><font color="#666666">loco</font></b><font color="#999999">
looked superb and I (foolishly in retrospect) decided on a release date.&nbsp;
I returned from holidays and set about finishing off and packaging the
loco.&nbsp; It was then that I discovered that the .S and .ACE files no
longer matched: hence the reason for declaring the failure.&nbsp; The screenshot
(reproduced below) was never intended to deceive, rather to "simulate"
(now where have we heard that word before?) a prototype problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was hoped that the textures could be fixed quickly, and most were, but
there remains the problem of the tender wheels: these must wait till Joseph
has time to re-work them (or until there are 48 hours in one day&lt;g!>).</font></font>
<center>
<p><img src="images/r711_problem.jpg" nosave="" height="390" width="700"></p></center>

<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#999999">In the meantime, R711's .ENG
file is being tweaked to give it a more oil-burning feel as many advances
in understanding .ENG files have emerged since the first .ENG file was
written almost a year ago (MSTS currently doesn't support oil-burners).&nbsp;
The loco will then be going out to selected* beta testers as soon as the
.ENG file mods are complete (and ahead of the final shape adjustments).&nbsp;
Then, and only then will it be released.&nbsp; In the meantime the website
will continue to offer fine Australian outline models tested and packaged
up ready for you to run.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (* = don't ask, they've
already been selected)</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#999999">And for that small but vocal
minority who are always bleating "</font><b><i><font color="#666666">why
doesn't someone do this</font></i></b><font color="#999999">" or "</font><b><i><font color="#666666">why
doesn't someone do a proper version of that model, more to scale,&nbsp;
with transparent windows and a better paint job - oh and do all the liveries
while they're at it</font></i></b><font color="#999999">" and "</font><b><i><font color="#666666">when
are you going to finish your route or at least some more screenshots</font></i></b><font color="#999999">"
- you do have a simple solution available: </font><b><font color="#666666"><font size="+1">build
the bloody things yourself</font></font></b><font color="#999999">!&nbsp;
Then you can show us all how it should be done, how your model is sooo
much better than anyone else's and how quickly you can churn out model
after model after model, all perfect in every detail, correctly liveried
to the nth degree and of course, perfectly to scale.&nbsp; Go on, that
"someone" could be you - stop talking the talk, now walk the walk.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#999999">3D Canvas is free, Gmax is
free, you already have a paint program (Paint) on your computer and/or
if you have a scanner it probably came bundled with Photoshop LE or Ulead
PhotoImpact while PC magazine cover CDs often have Paintshop Pro for evaluation.&nbsp;
There are dozens of tutorials on this web site and elsewhere on the web
as well as countless people who'll help you get up when you fall over.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you've got a PC that plays MSTS, you've already got all the tools to
reskin and then build for MSTS.</font></font>

- don't be a "gimme pig"!&nbsp; So, now what's your excuse?</font></font>

Spinella (who's been away) following what appears to be a file-corruption

abuse over the delay in the release of this locomotive:&nbsp; - it will
not speed matters up at all.&nbsp; The loco will be released when it is
ready to go, no sooner, no later.&nbsp;&nbsp; This version will NOT have
a 3D cab in an effort to release this model as soon as possible - the cab
will follow some time later (believe it or not, some people DO have a life

brought up the issue of installing Australian MSTS models in non-English
speaking countries.&nbsp; Basically the problem occurs because the folder
"<b><font color="#009900">Program Files</font></b>" is named in the local
language for each country, but sub-folders such as "Microsoft Games" and
"Train Simulator" remain in English: thus for a Brazilian PC, you need
to ensure that "<b><font color="#009900">Program Files</font></b>" is replaced
with the Portugese version "<b><font color="#009900">Arquivos de programas</font></b>":&nbsp;
obviously other countries need to check and replace "<b><font color="#009900">Program
Files</font></b>" with the appropriate folder name.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope
this tip will help our international visitors install the models provided
here by great Aussie designers.</font>

Quite out of the blue in my inbox this afternoon is another Joseph Spinella
creation - this time the NSWGR C30 class 4-6-4T tank locomotive, specifically
3112.&nbsp;&nbsp; Featuring its own cab view, this delightful little locomotive
is now available for download in <a href="#sl">Steam Locomotive section</a>
below: I concede it's jumped the queue of models awaiting placement, but
then this IS the

Well in Victoria up to today you could haul grain, containers, gypsum,
cement, cattle, steel, even van goods.&nbsp; Now it's time to schedule
some passenger trains as&nbsp; designer Michael Thompson has released his
<b><font size="+1">BS
passenger cars</font></b> in four liveries covering a fifty year plus time
span:</font>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Verdana">Victorian Railways blue &amp; gold;</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Verdana">V/Line orange;</font></li>

<li>

</ul>

<font face="Verdana">The usual superb no-fuss <b><font color="#000099">steam</font><font color="#FF0000">4</font><font color="#000099">me</font></b>
installer makes these carriages ready to be made up into a consist and
run.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look for them in the&nbsp; <a href="#pc">Passenger Cars</a>
section below.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">It's a big day for passengers in NSW as well as
Michael Thompson's<font size="+1"> <b>FO cars</b> </font>are released here
as well.&nbsp; Used on the NSW suburban system early last century, they'll
look great behind Joseph Spinella's 30 class, also available here.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana">The <b><font size="+1">NSWGR FS</font></b> cars are
finally back as well, this time with tail lights and a correct sound file
aliased to the Scotsman passenger cars, something that's been missing from
<b>all</b>
the releases so far.&nbsp; As well they're packaged up into the fail-safe
installer you've all come to trust here at the <b><font color="#000099">steam</font><font color="#FF0000">4</font><font color="#000099">me</font></b>

<p><font face="Verdana">An email from Ruben Brissac from Rio de Janiero,
Brazil <font size="-1">( he assures me that the girls on Ipanema are "more
beautiful and naked"&nbsp; than the last time I visited Rio!!)&nbsp;</font>
brought up the issue of installing Australian MSTS models in non-English
speaking countries.&nbsp; Basically the problem occurs because the folder
"<b><font color="#009900">Program Files</font></b>" is named in the local
language for each country, but sub-folders such as "Microsoft Games" and
"Train Simulator" remain in English: thus for a Brazilian PC, you need
to ensure that "<b><font color="#009900">Program Files</font></b>" is replaced
with the Portugese version "<b><font color="#009900">Arquivos de programas</font></b>":&nbsp;
obviously other countries need to check and replace "<b><font color="#009900">Program
Files</font></b>" with the appropriate folder name.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope
this tip will help our international visitors install the models provided
here by great Aussie designers.</font>

Joseph Spinella's CPH has arrived on the ready tracks here at the <b><font color="#000099">steam</font><font color="#FF0000">4</font><font color="#000099">me</font></b>
site.&nbsp; The "Tin Hare" was a familiar site in NSW many years ago and
this model will unlock nostalgic memories.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again this
model is packaged within an installer - just run and play - couldn't be
simpler.&nbsp; This model has been enhanced by changes to lighting and
the interior appearance of the cab (more details in readme.txt when model
is installed).&nbsp; You will find the CPH for download in the <b><a href="#rm">Passenger

are many models and tutorials in the queue, so I'll work through them and
