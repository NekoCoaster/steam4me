            <br>by Yuri Sos</h2>
            <p></p>
            <h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
            <div class="entry">

               <p>I've decided it's time to upgrade my install guide. It's mostly the same as previous guides and has
                  been tested on a "virgin" Windows 10 pro 64-bit HP Deskpro that's recently been retired from active
                  duty. An MSI GT 1030 SFF card has been installed and a pure/unenhanced version of Windows 10 Pro
                  installed.


               <P>The process is VERY similar to previous installations but I hope a few tweaks to make it easier along
                  the way.</p>

               <h2>Any issues to look out for?</h2>

               <ul>
                  <li>It appears that MSTS will install <b>but not run</b> on PCs fitted with standard Intel Graphics
                     cards (theses are often embedded in the motherboard). Stick to nVidia graphics
                     cards.<br>&nbsp;<br /></li>

                  <li>It appears that MSTS will install <b>but not run</b> on PCs fitted with AMD/Radeon graphics cards.
                     Ged Saunders over on uktrainsim writes <i>"The last version of the HD Series drivers available from
                        the AMD site which enables MSTS to work under Windows 10 with an AMD HD graphics card (plus
                        "fix") is 16.8.3. This is shown as 16.300.2511.1003, dated 30/08/2016 on the Driver properties
                        screen (from Device Manager)."</i> The challenge appears to be that Windows Update updates these
                     drivers rendering MSTS unplayable. Once again best to stick to nVidia graphics
                     cards.<br>&nbsp;<br /></li>
                  <li>Default MSTS will not run on UHD monitors (ie resolutions greater than 2048 pixeds) - there are
                     patches available (beyond the scope of this particular tutorial).</li>
               </ul>

               <h3>Ok, let's get started.</h3>

               <p>If you're using Windows XP (really? - in 2021? "C'mon, man!"), <br>read <b><a

         <!--- Uninstalling your old MSTS --->

         <div class="post">
            <h2 class="title">Uninstalling your old MSTS</h2>
            <div class="entry">

               <p>If this install is a re-install, you're going to have to uninstall the old version first.</p>

               <ol>
                  <li>Move all your non-default routes, trainsets and consists away from your MSTS\Routes folder
                     <b>BEFORE</b> uninstalling. Leaving them in the \Routes subfolder and re-installing MSTS seems to
                     corrupt non-default routes (you end up with tracks and objects, but no terrain at least or an
                     unusable route at worst, plus there are missing .S files in some of your trainsets);
                  </li>
                  <li>Uninstall MSTS via "<b>Add/Remove Programs</b>" in Control Panel;</li>
                  <li>Use Explorer to delete any residual MSTS folders (anything you've added to the installation needs
                     to be manually deleted). These steps should clear the registry as well as the hard drive.</li>
               </ol>

            <a Name="preparation" </a>

         <!--- Preparation --->

         <div class="post">
            <h2 class="title">Preparation</h2>
            <div class="entry">

               <p>This is the default UAC (User Account Control) setting in Windows 10: you don't need to touch it.</P>

               <br> <img src="images/msts_install_w7_01.jpg" height="560" alt="" border="0">

               <p>It does have a nuisance component, though, so I usually turn it down one step as shown in image below:

                  and click "Ok".</p>

         <!--- Installation --->

         <div class="post">
            <h2 class="title">Installation</h2>
            <div class="entry">

               <p>When you first insert your CD into the drive, Windows will ask you to select what to do in a pop-up in
                  the lower right corner of your screen:

               <p> <img src="images/what_to_do.jpg" alt="" border="2">

               <p>Click on that pop-up and select <b>"Open folder to view files"</b>:

               <p> <img src="images/cd_options.jpg" alt="" border="0">

               <p>When the folder opens, <b>RIGHT-CLICK</b> on setup.exe and select "<b>Run As Administrator</b>":

               <p> <img src="images/setup_runasadmin.jpg" alt="" border="0">

               <p>Windows will try to install MSTS in its default folder,
                  <br><b>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator</b> in 32-bit systems or
                  <br><b>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator</b> in Windows 64-bit systems.
               </p>

               <h2>
                  <font color=red>
                     <center>DO *NOT* INSTALL MSTS TO THE SUGGESTED DEFAULT FOLDER</center>
                  </font>
               </h2>

               <p>Stay out of the Program Files folder altogether: install MSTS to another folder, say, <b>
                     <font color="blue">C:\1MSTS</font>
                  </b> or even another drive, for example <b>
                     <font color="blue">X:\1MSTS</font>
                  </b> where X: is your target drive (local or external)- naming the folder thus will cause it to rise
                  to the top of your folder listing in Explorer and is a lot easier to type into "Save" dialogues.</p>

               <p>Windows 10 thinks it's "protecting" (but it interferes with the modification and installation of)
                  files in the Program Files folder, often leading to errors with batch files running and activities
                  unpacking. Installing MSTS outside "Program Files" also makes it much easier to move or access MSTS
                  files across your wired or wireless network. </p>

               <p>The following images show you the way:</p>

               <ol>
                  <li>Click on "Install"
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_04.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>Click on Right-Arrow
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_05.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>Adobe Acrobat on the MSTS disk is about version 4: with a Win10 machine, you'll most likely have
                     Adobe Reader 10 or higher, so skip this step (ie say "no")
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_06.jpg" height="367" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>Click on the radio button labelled "<b>Customize Installation Options"</b> (1) then click on
                     right-arrow (2):
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_07.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>Click the "Complete Install" radio button (1) , then "Change" (2) then Right-Arrow (3)
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_08.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>Select the drive you wish to use, then type in the name of the folder you wish to install to (here
                     I've chosen "1MSTS" as my install folder).......
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_09.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>..... and I've promptly made a mistake: you must type drive and folder in the field for the path
                     to the program:
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_10.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>Go back and make sure the path reads drive AND folder as below:
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_11.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>If the folder doesn't exist, you'll be asked to ok its creation:
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_12.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>Check that everything is now as you've selected and click on the right-arrow to commence the
                     actual installation:
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_13.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>The program creates the necessary folders...................
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_14.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>..... and then starts the installation proper, a locomotive travelling slowly across the tracks to
                     mark progress:
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_15.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>At 29%, you'll be prompted to insert CD2: do so, wait till the CD drive spins up, then press
                     <b>OK</b>. Installation proceeds:
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_16.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>Installation proceeds......
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_17.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>....and completes.
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_20.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>Now restart your computer as instructed:
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_21.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>You will have an MSTS icon on your desktop, thus:
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w10_22.jpg" height="" alt="" border="2">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>If you click <b>Start | All Apps | Microsoft Games |Programs | Microsoft Games </b>, you will see
                     that the "Editors and Tools" icon is also present (new users continually post "I don't have a link
                     to the Tools!" Yes, you do!):
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w10_99.jpg" height="" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>I prefer to move my commonly used icons to the Start menu: right click on <b>Train Simulator</b>
                     and select "<b>Pin to Start</b>". Repeat for the <b>Editor and Tools</b> app:
                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w10_99a.jpg" height="" alt="" border="0">

                     <p>I then create a "New Group" entitled <b>MSTS</b> and move the two icons there, thus:

                     <p><img src="images/msts_install_w10_99b.jpg" height="" alt="" border="0">
                     <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  </li>
               </ol>

               <p>Right, that takes care of the basic installation. Now it's on to the upgrades and enhancements.
               <p>

               <h3>Don't start MSTS just yet.</h3>

                  <li>It's the version of MSTS that <b>must</b> be present for you to install and run MSTS-Bin (more of
                     that later).</li>
               </ol>

               <p>A discussion of the different versions of MSTS may be found at <a
                     href="../MSTS_Updates/index.html">MSTS Downloads Page</a>, but to simplify things: if you have an
                  MSTS purchased after 2003 and/or distributed by Atari, Ubisoft or Xplosiv, you already have version
                  1.4. If you're in any doubt on the version you have, look in your TRAINSET folder: if you have the
                  SD402 or Class50 inter alia you already have v1.4.</p>

               <p>From the <a href="../MSTS_Updates/index.html">MSTS Downloads Page</a> site, download and run the
                  <b>MSTS v1.4 Train Simulator Update</b>. Click "ok" at the next screen....
               </p>

               <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_23.jpg" alt="" border="0"></p>

               <p>..... then point the installer to your MSTS folder (this installer by default points to a "C:\Program
                  Files\" folder, so you'll need to alter it), and click Unzip. You'll receive a confirmation message
                  that files have been unzipped. You may then need to restart your PC to ensure that you're not pestered
                  by the "insert disk in drive" message. </p>

               <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_25.jpg" alt="" border="0"></p>

               <p>Now, if you don't have the SD402 nor the Class50, go back to <a href="../MSTS_Updates/index.html">MSTS
                     Downloads Page</a> and download and install the Class50 and SD402 content. Many model builders
                  alias sounds and cabview files to the Sd402 and Class50; some refrigerator wagons also use sounds
                  aliased from SD402 content.</p>

               <p>Many freeware downloadable routes require one or more add-ons to make them work properly: in order of

                     <p>Major improvements include operation of dual cabs and improvements to camera viewpoints, train

               <p>I was pleasantly surprised at how trouble-free the installation went, always expecting that Microsoft
                  will go out of their way to make things "difficult". Certainly in this case, the process was smoothly
                  undertaken.</p>

               <p>Your MSTS is now installed and error-free as far as the original installation goes.</p>

               <p>Of course, from here you have thousands of locomotives, routes and other add-ons to enhance your
                  simulation experience.</p>

               <p>Enjoy.</p>
