 			   <div class="entry">

                              <p>(2010) - I've been receiving many emails asking me to do a Windows 7 version of my MSTS Install Guide that some people have referred to as the "MSTS Install Bible".</p>

                              <P>Having now installed MSTS on several Windows 7 machines, I've decided the time has come for a dedicated Windows 7-based tutorial (plus a new Windows 7 PC at work gave me a "virgin" machine to work on).</p>

 <p><font color="blue">(2021) By the way if you've arrived here from an old forum link, there's now a Windows 10 install tutorial;
                              <br>read <b><a href="installing_msts_win10.html">Installing MSTS on a Windows 10 PC</a></b>. </font>
                              <p>Ok, let's get started.</p>

                              <p>If you're using Windows XP (really? - in 2021? "C'mon, man!"), <br>read <b><a href="installing_msts_xp.html">Installing MSTS on a Windows XP PC</a></b>.

			<div class="entry">

                           <p>If this install is a re-install, you're going to have to uninstall the old version first.</p>

                           <ol>
                               <li>Move all your non-default routes, trainsets and consists away from your MSTS\Routes folder <b>BEFORE</b> uninstalling.  Leaving them in the \Routes subfolder and re-installing MSTS seems to corrupt non-default routes (you end up with tracks and objects, but no terrain at least or an unusable route at worst, plus there are missing .S files in some of your trainsets);</li>
                               <li>Uninstall MSTS via "Add/Remove Programs" in Control Panel;</li>
                               <li>Use Explorer to delete any residual MSTS folders (anything you've added to the installation needs to be manually deleted).  These steps should clear the registry as well as the hard drive.</li>

    <!--- Preparation --->

		<div class="post">
			<h2 class="title">Preparation</h2>
			<div class="entry">

			   <p>In my opinion, there are two ways to install MSTS - the hard way and the easy way.</p>

                           <p>The hard way involves disconnecting from the internet, disabling UAC, installing, setting permissions, unblocking things, re-establishing UAC, re-connecting to the 'Net - it's all too fiddly and prone to errors and frustration.</p>

                           <p>I'm going to show you the easy (easier) way - no fiddling with the UAC, no disconnecting from the 'Net, (usually) no hassles with batch files, etc.</p>

                           <p>This is the default UAC (User Account Control) setting in Windows 7: you don't need to  touch it.</P>

                           <br> <img src="images/msts_install_w7_01.jpg" height="560" alt="" border="0">

                           <p>It does have a nuisance component, though, as it asks to for permission to proceed on every single step, thus</p>

                           <br><img src="images/msts_install_w7_02.jpg" height="327" alt="" border="0">

                           <p>We can get rid of these pesky messages without compromising the security of your system.</p>

                           <p>Browse to <a href=https://www.winability.com/tweak-uac/>https://www.winability.com/tweak-uac/</a> and download and install Tweak-UAC.  Run Tweak-UAC and select <b>"Switch UAC to the quiet mode"</b>, thus</p>

                           <br> <img src="images/msts_install_w7_03.jpg" height="344" alt="" border="0">

                           <p>This option does not turn off UAC; instead, it only makes UAC to operate in the quiet mode. In the quiet mode, UAC does not display the elevation prompts for the administrators. (This TweakUAC tip was provided on the UKTS forums by Doug Kightley.)  <i>To the naysayers: can you honestly say that you carefully read each UAC prompt..... or do you, like a majority of users, simply click "allow" automatically? Do note that UAC only "protects" system files - it does nothing to stop malware and viruses getting into the rest of your system and emailing everyone in your address book on the benefits of body part enlargement.</i></p>

                           <p>Right, now we're good to go.</p>

    <!--- Installation --->

		<div class="post">
			<h2 class="title">Installation</h2>
			<div class="entry">

                           <br> <img src="images/msts_install_w7_03a.jpg" alt="" border="0">

                           <p>When you run setup, Windows will try to install MSTS in its default folder, 
                              <br><b>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator</b> in 32-bit systems or 
                              <br><b>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator</b> in Windows 64-bit systems.</p>

                           <h2><font color=red><center>DO *NOT* INSTALL MSTS TO THE SUGGESTED DEFAULT FOLDER</center></font></h2>

                           <p>Stay out of the Program Files folder altogether: install MSTS to another folder, say, <b><font color="#009900">C:\1MSTS</font></b> or even another drive, for example <b><font color="#009900">X:\1MSTS</font></b> where X: is your target drive (local or external)- naming the folder thus will cause it to rise to the top of your folder listing in Explorer and is a lot easier to type into "Save" dialogues.</p>

                           <p>Vista and Windows 7 OSs "protect" (ie interfere with the modification and installation of) files in the Program Files folder, often leading to errors with batch files running and activities unpacking.  Installing MSTS outside "Program Files" also makes it much easier to move or access MSTS files across your wired or wireless network. </p>

                           <p>The following images show you the way:</p>

                           <ol>
                               <li>Click on "Install"
                                  <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_04.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">

                               </li>

                               <li>Click on Right-Arrow
                                  <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_05.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">

                               </li>

                               <li>Adobe Acrobat on the MSTS disk is about version 4: with a Win7 machine, you'll most likely have Adobe Reader 8 or 9, so skip this step (ie say "no")
                                  <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_06.jpg" height="367" alt="" border="0">

                               </li>

                               <li>Click on the radio button labelled "<b>Customize Installation Options"</b>:
                                  <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_07.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">

                               </li>

                               <li>Click the "Complete Install" radio button (1) , then "Change" (2) then Right-Arrow (3)
                                  <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_08.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">

                               </li>

                               <li>Select the drive you wish to use, then type in the name of the folder you wish to install to (here I've chosen "1MSTS" as my install folder).......

                               </li>

                               <li>..... and I've promptly made a mistake: you must type drive and folder in the field for the path to the program:
                                  <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_10.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">

                               </li>

                               <li>Go back and make sure the path reads drive AND folder as below:

                               <li>If the folder doesn't exist, you'll be asked to ok its creation:

                               <li>Check that everything is now as you've selected and click on the right-arrow to commence the actual installation:
                                  <p><img src="images/msts_install_w7_13.jpg" height="520" alt="" border="0">

                               <li>..... and then starts the installation proper, a locomotive travelling slowly across the tracks to mark progress:

                               <li>At 29%, you'll be prompted to insert CD2: do so, wait till the CD drive spins up, then press <b>OK</b>.  Installation proceeds:

                        <p>Install the web-based MSTS "update to patch v1.4".  Yes, irrespective of whatever you've just installed (Microsoft, Atari, Ubisoft, Xplosiv) you need to install the web update.</p>
                        
                        <p>"Why do I need to do this?" I may hear you asking?  Two reasons:
                        <ol>
                            <li>It removes the necessity to have an MSTS CD in the drive when you're playing the game; and</li>
                            <li>It's the version of MSTS that <b>must</b> be present for you to install and run MSTS-Bin (more of that later).</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>A discussion of the different versions of MSTS may be found at <a href="../MSTS_Updates/index.html">MSTS Downloads Page</a>, but to simplify things: if you have an MSTS purchased after 2003 and/or distributed by Atari, Ubisoft or Xplosiv, you already have version 1.4.  If you're in any doubt on the version you have, look in your TRAINSET folder:  if you have the SD402 or Class50 inter alia you already have v1.4.</p>

                        <p>..... then point the installer to your MSTS folder (this installer by default points to a "C:\Program Files\" folder, so you'll need to alter it), and click Unzip.  You'll receive a confirmation message that files have been unzipped.  You may then need to restart your PC to ensure that you're not pestered by the "insert disk in drive" message. </p>

                               <p>Major improvements include operation of dual cabs and improvements to camera viewpoints, train operations and general robustness. There are a number of other mprovementsin how MSTS handles front coupling, an increase in the number of objects it can cope with at one time (which should help robustness especially on big routes), graphical improvements to the train operations screen and a number of other tweaks.  <br><a href="http://forums.uktrainsim.com/viewtopic.php?t=59227&sid=1e1a793f681f10d0fc465f1c0c23041a">The FAQ Page for MSTS-Bin</a> should be your first stop to understand more about this exciting patch to MSTS.</p>

                           <li><b>UK Finescale</b> - UK FineScale (UKFS) is a comprehensive track system based on UK track specifications. Although designed for UK operation, UKFS can be used for routes in other countries where the gauge is 1.435m and the standard double track separation is 3.41m (or similar). This track system brings parallel tracks much closer to together. The <a href="http://www.trainsimfiles.com/products/ukfs/">Trainsimfiles.com</a> website is currently off-line, but you can download the UKFS installer by clicking on this link: <a href="../routes/files/UKFS_v3_1_6_full.exe">UKFS_v3_1_6_full.exe</a>.
