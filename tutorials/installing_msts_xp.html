          <h3>Don't you just love this pop-up screen?</h3>

          <p>Whether you're installing MSTS for the first time or, as many of us seem to, for the umpteenth time, this
            checklist of the basic "essential" steps will get your MSTS installation "back on the tracks" in a minimum
            of time with a minimum of frustration.&nbsp; It is not intended to be a full list of available utilities,
            patches, physics upgrades and fixes, but rather just the basic necessities that you should consider
            immediately after (re)installing MSTS.&nbsp; Feedback is always welcome: <a
              href="mailto:steam4me@pobox.com">email me</a>.</p>

          <p>I'm not suggesting for a moment that whenever you see the screenshot above, you should re-install MSTS, but
            sometimes there is no other way to correct some of MSTS' weirdnesses that crop up from time to time <i>(for
              example, my last failure was that MSTS stopped recognising electric locomotives - it didn't matter whether
              they were default or add-ons, they simply were not recognised by the game).</i></p>

          <p>I know that theoretically you'll never have to re-install MSTS once installed (yet look at the registry
            hacks and other fixes that abound on the 'Net) but you sometimes need to consider the amount of time that
            you can spend time trying to work out which add-on caused the problem: at some point it becomes more
            time-effective to re-install MSTS than to continue to chase every rabbit down every burrow.</p>

          <p>Ok, let's get started. (By the way, if you're using Internet Explorer 8 or higher, select "Compatibility
            View" to ensure correct display).</p>

          <p>If you're using Windows 7 (or Vista), read <b><a href="installing_msts_w7.html">Installing MSTS on a
                Windows 7 PC</a></b>.

      <!--- Uninstalling your old MSTS --->

      <div class="post">
        <h2 class="title">Uninstalling your old MSTS</h2>
        <div class="entry">

          <p>If you're going to uninstall (I recommend uninstall then re-install) your MSTS, move all your non-default
            routes away from your MSTS\Routes folder <b>BEFORE</b> uninstalling.>/p>

          <p>Leaving them in the \Routes subfolder and re-installing MSTS seems to corrupt non-default routes (you end
            up with tracks and objects, but no terrain at least or an unusable route at worst - believe me..... I've
            been there, done that, torn my hair out!!).</p>

          <p><b>EDIT/UPDATE</b>: I used to say here <i>"I also move my TRAINSET folder and CONSISTS folder, but I've not
              seen them corrupted in a re-install."</i></p>

          <p>I had occasion to re-install an MSTS on an XP SP3 machine and found that many items of rolling stock no
            longer functioned properly - missing .S files, textures, etc. I went back to an old XP SP2 machine and
            performed an experimental re-install and the TRAINS folder survived the re-install. So on my machines at
            least, you can get corruption of existing rolling stock folder contents if using XP SP3 or higher.</p>

          <p>On the basis of that, I've changed my mind: the advice now is "<b>Move away your TRAINS folder if you want
              to keep rolling stock intact.</b>". It's better to be safe than sorry.</p>

          <p>Uninstall MSTS via "Add/Remove Programs" in Control Panel, then use Explorer to delete any residual MSTS
            folders (anything you've added to the installation needs to be manually deleted). These two steps should
            clear the registry as well as the hard drive.</p>

      <!--- Installation --->

      <div class="post">
        <h2 class="title">Installation</h2>
        <div class="entry">

          <p>Rather than installing to <b>
              <font color="#009900">C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator</font>
            </b>, you might like to consider installing MSTS to another folder or even drive, say, <b>
              <font color="#009900">D:\1MSTS</font>
            </b> where D: is your target drive - naming the folder thus will cause it to rise to the top of your folder
            listing in Explorer and is a lot easier to type into "Save" dialogues.</p>

          <p>Installing MSTS to a folder OUTSIDE "Program Files" will also lessen the grief of using <b>MSTS with Vista
              and Windows 7</b> as these OSs "protect" (ie interfere with the modification and installation of) files in
            the Program Files folder: often leading to errors with batch files running and activities unpacking.</p>

          <p>Many freeware downloadable routes require one or more add-ons to make them work properly: in order of
            popularity, they are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b><a href="../routes/xtracks.html">Xtracks</a></b> - an expanded range of straight, curved, trolley,
              bridge, tunnel track pieces, as well as switches (turnouts), crossovers and a turntable. This link takes
              you to the Xtracks page at Steam4me where the latest version is always available.
              <br>&nbsp;
            </li>

            <li><b><a href="../routes/newroads.html">Newroads</a></b> - an expanded range of straight, curved, sealed,
              unsealed, freeway road pieces, as well as junctions and intersections. This link takes you to the Newroads
              page at Steam4me where the latest version is always available.
              <br>&nbsp;
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>In my opinion, Xtracks and Newroads are <b>must downloads</b>.</p>

            - a new track profile and textures means that routes using ScaleRail will demonstrate a greater degree of
            realism. This link takes you to the ScaleRail download page at <a

            <li><b>UK Finescale</b> - UK FineScale (UKFS) is a comprehensive track system based on UK track
              specifications. Although designed for UK operation, UKFS can be used for routes in other countries where
              the gauge is 1.435m and the standard double track separation is 3.41m (or similar). This track system
              brings parallel tracks much closer to together. The <a

              the basic product MSTSbin actually provides a whole new set of features as well as a number of fixes to
              some issues in Train Simulator.
              <p>Major improvements include operation of dual cabs and improvements to camera viewpoints, train
                operations and general robustness. There are a number of other mprovementsin how MSTS handles front
                coupling, an increase in the number of objects it can cope with at one time (which should help
                robustness especially on big routes), graphical improvements to the train operations screen and a number
                of other tweaks. <br><a
