                     <p>With most new desktops and laptops now arriving with 64-bit Windows 7 or 8 operating systems, MSTS users will find "challenges" with installing some of their favourite software as some installers are only 16-bit and 16-bit is not supported on 64-bit systems.</p>

                     <p>One of the perennial favourites thus affected is <b>Train Sim Modeler</b>. Ged Saunders has come up with a simple and elegant method of installing TSM into a 64-bit system that solves the problem.

                     <p>Working on preparing a route for release, I needed to update the route by adding extra cross-over nodes, including one over a three-way junction.  Having done this, I thought I would share this work by writing a tutorial, or more precisely, adding a section to Jeff Kraus-Yao's tutorial on <a href="make_xover.html#complex">creating cross-over nodes</a>.</p>

                     <p>That then led me to respond to a few emails from people wanting to know if it was possible to fully protect double-slips: I don't think they realised that the problem could be solved by using the <a href="gantlet.html">Signalling Gantlet Track</a> tutorial.  I decided I better create a tutorial on fixing double slips.  Click on the "Read More" link below at right.</p>

                     <p>Matt Austin is one of team-ALCO's skilled model builders and arguably one one of Australia's best modellers.  Many Australian MSTS users know of his fine work with the VR D3, the team-ALCO Spirit Spirit Of Progress passenger stock and the extraordinary forthcoming "Tait" suburban train stock.  One of the reasons Matt's been able to produce such detailed models that run reliably in the sim is that he has used the freeware application for TSM, Polymaster.</p>
                     
                     <p>Matt has written a superb tutorial on using Polymaster to improve the quality and reliability of models created with TSM.

                     <p>Finally, after many hours' work, all tutorials (over 150 HTML pages' worth) are now available for your education and assistance.  They represent a huge store of research and knowledge about the game many of us seem to be addicted to: the authors have shared their knowledge and work generously for the whole MSTS community.</p>

                     <p>So it is with much sadness and a distinct feeling of despondency that I note that the sledging on flamesim.com (aka train-sim.com) has resumed with some offensive comments by one of their members. A Mr Erick Cantu has slammed a sound tutorial on the steam4me site, saying "it contains some half-truths and a few outright lies".</p>

                     <p>For the record, Mr Erick Cantu has, to my knowledge, never emailed me to offer corrections or point out errors in any tutorials on this site.  It seems he finds it much easier to offer abuse and sledge the work of others than constructive criticism. To accuse the author(s) on this site (or me) of telling lies is completely offensive, slanderous and totally outrageous.</p>

                     <p>There are days where I wonder why I bother......... this is one of them.</p>

                     <p>The demise of Railpage and subsequent loss of the steam4me site on their servers has necessitated some "re-organisation".  As you've no doubt discovered (otherwise you wouldn't be reading this), I've set up my own site.   I'm taking advantage of my move to a new server to rewrite many of the tutorials, with more links within pages to enable them to be more easily accessed and linked to.<p>

                     <p>As time permits, I am progressively returning tutorials to the site in what I consider order of importance. Email me (see Contacts page) if there's one you need returned more quickly.</p>

           <p>This menu contains the titles of all the tutorials that have been written.  You will get an error message for the tutes that haven't yet been uploaded.  I will post again here when I think I've uploaded all the tutorials.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Kraus-Yao's cross-over nodes started me thinking about other vexing track-building / signalling issues within MSTS.  After some investigation, I've discovered that Jeffrey's cross over nodes can be used to protect non-intersecting track such as gantlet track or mixed-gauge track.</p>

<p>I've documented the process of protecting a stretch of gantlet track in a tutorial - <a href="gantlet.html">Signalling Gantlet Track in MSTS</a> - but the process will be useful to route-builders working on routes covering South Australia, Brisbane Metro area, Switzerland and America's Colorado narrow gauge systems where more than one gauge was in use and mixed- or dual-gauge trackage was used at stations and in yards.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Kraus-Yao has made an astounding discovery that could revolutionise complicated track-work construction in MSTS and still allow correct signalling. Route-builders can now build complicated junctions and know that they can be protected by signals that will work correctly in activities.</p>

<p>Up till now, only specialised shapes with a crossing node have ensured correct interlocking.  His technique will ensure that two tracks laid one over the other can be made to provide protection by signals for use in activities.</p>

Whether you're installing MSTS for the first time or, as many of us seem to, for the umpteenth time, this checklist of the basic "essential" steps will get your MSTS installation "back on the tracks" in a minimum of time with a minimum of frustration. Windows XP and Windows 7 versions.</p>

You've set up your monitor, but recent versions of ATI Catalyst Centre don't allow you to enable GPU scaling.  Yes, they do and here's an illustrated tutorial to demonstrate the procedure.</p>

                        <p><b><a href="context.html">Using the ConTEXT Editor in MSTS</a></b> by Yuri Sos, based on ground-breaking work by Pete Willard.
