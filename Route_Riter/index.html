                        <p></p>
			<h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
 			   <div class="entry">

                <p>Route-Riter v7 is a suite of over 110 utilities for performing various actions on sections of the Microsoft Train Simulator program.</p>

                <p>The major options are as follows:-
                <ol>
                   <li>Check a Route for missing shape and texture files;
                   </li>

                   <li>Compact a Route by removing files from the route which are not required and just serve to slow the program down;
                   </li>

                   <li>Check all Activities installed in the Simulator;
                   </li>

                   <li>Package a route ready for uploading (including production of spanned zip files);
                   </li>

                   <li>Count objects in selected and adjacent World tiles;
                   </li>

                   <li>List all the track and road sections used by a route;
                   </li>

                   <li>Produce 'Mini-Routes', i.e. compact versions of MSTS which contain only one route and associated rolling stock;
                   </li>

                   <li>Options to check and fix many of the file types used by MSTS for operating routes, rolling stock and activities;
                   </li>

                   <li>A host of utilities to compress and uncompress files, replace shapes in .W files, build AI locomotives etc.;
                   </li>

                   <li>Graphics utilities which allow the user to view shape files and consists in full colour, run 3rd party programs such as TGATools2a and TView etc.;
                   </li>

                   <li>a fully-fledged Consist Builder (freeware) is also included;
                   </li>

                   <li>The full version of Carl-Heinz Rave's TSUtils program is also included;
                   </li>

                   <li>Route-Riter supports the following languages: English, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese and Spanish. Select the appropriate language from the Files | Language menu.
                   </li>
                   </ol>

                                   <p>Follow these steps to correct this problem:</p>
                                   <blockquote>
                                       <p>a. Uninstall <b>ALL</b> versions of Java via <b>Start | Control Panel | Add/Remove Programs</b>.  You may find one or more cannot be completely uninstalled. Don't worry about that at the moment.
                                       <p>b. Go to <b>C:\Program Files\Java</b> and delete all files and folders.
                                       <p>c. Go to <b>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>myusername</i>\Application Data</b> and delete the <b>Sun</b> folder.
                                       <p>d. Download and install the Microsoft Office <a href="files/msicuu2.exe">Windows Installer CleanUp Utility</a>;</p></blockquote></li>
                                       <p>e. Run the Windows Installer Cleanup Utility and look for Java (see image below):

                                       <br>The possibility is that the Route Riter 6 registry entry has become messed up, in which case it will be necessary to use Regedit, and look for the entry:

                                       <p><b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VB and VBA Program Settings\Route_Riter6</b></p>

                                       <p>Right click on Route_Riter6 (and Route_Riter as well if it exists from a previous version) and select Delete from the menu. The program should then run OK. (The registry entries are then re-written when you next exit RR.)
                                       <br>&nbsp;</p></li>


                                       <li><i><font color="#cc0066">The Route_Riter main window opens too high on my screen and I cannot drag it back into place</font></i>
                                           <br>There must be a problem with the registry entry for Route_Riter as this tells RR to open on the screen in the position it was closed in.

                                           <p>I suggest
                                           <ol>
                                               <li>you run Regedit from the Start menu run box, and navigate to <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\VB and VBA Program Settings\Route_Riter6</b></li>
                                               <li>Click on Route_Riter6 and under it you will see an entry Startupk;</li>
                                               <li>Left-click on Startup and you should see entries for Height/Left/Top/Width</li>

                                       <br>This can be caused by the ZIP dll not being registered correctly. This can be overcome by going to the Desktop Start/Run box and entering:-

                                       <br>This is similar to 3. above: Windows 98 does not natively read .chm files, so needs hhctrl.ocx installed to do this, this file must also be registered as above:-

                                       <p>This response indicates Java/TsUtil is correctly installed. However I found that on my PC, I had to place the TsUtil class and properties files into the folder c:\program files\java\jre1.6.0_nn\Classes as mentioned in the readme.txt file in the TsUtil folder of Route-Riter. This fixed everything up (Note: The folder jre1.6.0_xx number may vary depending upon your Java version).</p>

                                       <br>This is a 'false positive' report by recent versions of AVG, UHARC.exe is a compression program like WinZip widely used, however I am modifying Route_Riter (v7.0.74 onwards) so that if UHARC is missing, then the button for using it will be greyed out. In the meantime, anyone who is worried or annoyed by this AVG report can safely remove UHARC from the Route_Riter folder.

Error 75 usually means that a file is inaccessible because it is Read Only, but in this case it is caused by the .zip utility not being registered correctly.

                                       <br>As TsUtils is now used for all compress/uncompress operations within Route_Riter, <b>it is imperative that a working Java setup is running on your PC</b>. The latest version can always be downloaded from <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">Java Manual Downloads for All Operating Sytems</a>.  Make sure you download the 'Manual Download' version as Windows XP SP2 and higher have been found to block installation of the automatic version.

                                       <p>From v7.0.23, Route_Riter automatically runs a java script on startup, and will advise you if Java/TsUtils are not working. At which time Route_Riter will close.</p>

                                       <p>TsUtils is normally installed in the Route_Riter\TsUtils folder, but <b>if you have installed Java and it still does not work</b>, you should go to the Java folder, normally at c:\Program Files\Java, under which there may be several sub-folders like jre1.4.0 and jre1.6.0 - The one with the highest number is the latest version. Open this folder and you should see sub-folders bin and lib make a new folder 'classes' which will then appear between these two and copy the contents of the TsUtil folder into this new Classes folder. After which TsUtils should run OK.  You may then remove all older versions of Java (they occupy about 114MB per version) using the Start | Settings | Control Panel | Add/Remove Programs option.</p>

                                       <br>Route_Riter and MSTS both run fine under Vista and Windows 7.

                                       <p>Install Route_Riter V7 as usual under Vista using the Full-Install versions of RR.
                                       <br>You must also download and install Java to be able to use the TsUtils options.</p>

                                       <p>After that, RR should run fine under Vista/Windows 7, however it has been found that you may need to run Route_Riter as an administrator.</p>

                                       <p>To do this:-
                                       <ol>
                                           <li>Open the folder which contains the program file (by default C:\program files\Route_Riter}</li>
                                           <li>Right-click the Route_Riter.exe file</li>
                                           <li>On the Compatability tab, click the 'Run this program as an Administrator' check-box.</li>
                                           <li>Click OK, then the program will always run in Administrator mode.</li>
                                       </ol>

                                       <br>You have been blessed with yet another Microsoft security fix!  After a bit of online research, I discovered that Microsoft security update 896358 included changes to the InfoTech protocol that blocks the ability to view remote content. These changes were introduced to reduce security vulnerabilities in HTML Help.
                                       <p>The net effect of this "security update" is that you may find you are unable to open the Route Riter Help file:  you may see a message such as this:</p>

                                       <p><img src="images/rr_help_fix_01.jpg" width="696" alt="" border="0"></p>

                                       <p>Clicking on any option in Contents doesn't improve things at all</p>

                                       <p><img src="images/rr_help_fix_02.jpg" width="698" alt="" border="0"></p>

                                       <p>Fortunately, the cure is simple:  browse to "route_riter.chm" in Explorer, Right-click, select "Properties", and click on "Unblock".</p>

                                       <p>You will now be able to view the help file.</p>
