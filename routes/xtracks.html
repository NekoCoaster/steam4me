                             <p>You've downloaded a route and it says you need Xtracks to get it operating correctly.  This is the section for you.</p>

This installer also installs the latest version of tsection.dat (don't worry if you don't understand that, just know that it's a good thing to do).</p>

			<div class="entry">

            <ul>
               <li><b>Version 3.20</b> - (November 2007) - A quick update.
                   <br>Unfortunately there was a small mixup of a few shapes (2.5Pnts) concerning the textures. This is now corrected, other than that this release contains the same shapes as the previous one.
                   <br>TSection.dat build #38.
                   <br>&nbsp;
               </li>

               <li><b>Version 3.19</b> - (November 2007) - A full year since the last release.
                   <br>XTracks now is pretty much the work of Steven Masters and Norbert Rieger.  Okrasa Ghia only acts as the distributor of their work not adding anything myself.  Steven has added various crossings and bridge sections. Also some ferry sections, Norberts contribution is quite large and he has made a list of it all here.
                   <br>TSection.dat build #37.
                   <br>&nbsp;
               </li>

               <li><b>Version 3.18</b> - (November 2006) - At long last a new version of XTracks is finally released.
                   <br>There is an incredible amount of files added in this release.  Over 1.500 files by Steven Masters and Norbert Rieger.  Both new sections and updates of older sections with improved texturing and LODs. Lots of straights in various lengths and up to a10t* sections.  Lots of switches: ex. highspeed a1tHPnt1_5, a1tHPnt2 & a1tPnt2_5 and a2tHPnt1_5, a2tHPnt2 & a2tPnt2_5 by Norbert with lots more.  Steven Masters' compound switches and sections for building large yards, see his track laying page.  Okrasa'a contribution is an addition of some automatic stub switches to help in activity creation.
                   <br>TSection.dat build #35.
                   <br>&nbsp;
               </li>

               <li><b>Version 3.17</b> - Initially I thought this to be just a small maintenance release. Well not small perhaps with Steven supplying over a 100 updated shapes to cure the night problem with straights but still.  Then Norbert Rieger submitted a whole lot of new switches, slips and tunnels in high detail.  To view all his news please see his supplied <a href="http://www.nklj.se/xtracks/documents/laying2.htm" target="_blank">track laying page</a>.  Last and least the a2t3000r5dConcrete has been updated to use the correct texture.
                   <br>TSection.dat build #32.
                   <br>&nbsp;
               </li>

               <li><b>Version 3.16</b> - Steven Masters continues to add sections, now new straights all the way up to a10t500mStrt.  Also some updated curve shapes and a pair of new a1tYPnt10d150rMnl Y-switches with different default paths. Steven has also provided new tutorials for the track laying page.  I have added some frogs for Concrete; a2tFrog3d15m*Concrete and a2tFrog6d5m*Concrete. Have also added a number of new N-gauge high radius curves (1800r and 2400r), a few longer straigths (90m and 120m) and more n1tPnt3d and n1tFrog3d sections.  The documentation and web page are updated with new track charts listing all standard gauge tracks included with XTracks and from the original MSTS installation.
                  <br>TSection.dat build #31.
                  <br>&nbsp;
               </li>

               <li><b>Version 3.15</b> - I hope we finally got those straights sorted out now with this release. Steven Masters has added more sections, some different points.  a1tPnt5dS*, a1tPnt10d150r*_Div, a1tPnt2000r*3d, a1tPntM120rD90r & a1t52_5mStrt.  Okrasa has added new curves a1t375r*, a2t375r* and switches with diverging path a1tPnt3dB*Div, also some Xover between different gauges: NA1tXover6d*, uknA1tXover6d - these Xovers work with the 3d modular switches in yards; finally for Otto Wipfel the a1t1_2mStrt!
                   <br>TSection.dat build #30.

               <li><b>Version 3.14</b> - Chris Cyko's CYKWORKS elevated tracks are merged (C* & L* sections) into Xtracks, Norbert Rieger has initiated new subterrain sections, Zoltan Ivan has contributed replacements for a number of standard tracks with improved LOD handling, Steven Masters continues adding new shapes with replacements for the a1t870r4d* switches, new a1tPnt2000r*7d curved switches (a1tPnt2000r*3d coming later), frog sections a1tFrog3d20m3dBto10d, more two track straights in different lengths; 5, 15, 20, 25, 30 & 40 meter. Three track and four track 25m straights and new shapes for 6000r curves.  Finally Okrasa Ghia's added some a1tPnt6dB*Concrete switches.

               <li><b>Version 3.12</b> - Steven Masters has contributed a great many sections: Curved points both tighter (A1tPntM150*/A1tPntM250*) and wider (A1tPnt1500*) than before. 10 degree modular points (A1tPnt10d*) with provisions for a true three way switchs (A1tPnt3w*). New 3 degree and 5 degree frogs (A1tFrog3d*/A1tFrog5d*), 40 degree and 75 degree crossings (A1tXover40d/A1tXover75d). Replacement shapes for 5d points & 10d YPnt and finally also some additional small pieces to fit odds and ends with the others. Please check the track laying page for Steven's directions on how to use these new sections.   Mark Hyams's smooth curves are new, as are Okrasa Ghia's new tram sections (A1t5dTramCrv/A1t15dTramCrv). These are also available in dual line tracks (A2t*) and so is the old 30d (A2t30dTramCrv). I've also added a 4.985m straight that is usefull with 90 degree curves to get correct track spacing.  Also The 3000/6000 radius curves looked bad and thus has been updated.´
